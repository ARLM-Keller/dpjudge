Baron Powell is the designer of <b>1900</b>.
-->
<b>1900</b> is very similar to conventional <b>Diplomacy</b>, using
the same seven Great Powers.
<!-- &nbsp;-- only better,
if I do say so myself. --> What primarily distinguishes <b >1900</b> from
<b>Diplomacy</b> is the map, which shows Europe and the entire northern
coast of Africa at the turn of the century.  Features of the map are
discussed below.
<!--
There are also some unit
changes and two major rule changes.  These are discussed below.

<ul>
<li>There are thirty-nine supply centers.
Great Powers control twenty-five at game-start: Britain,
France, Germany, and Russia have four supply centers each and Austria-Hungary,
Italy, and Turkey have three supply centers each. The remaining
fourteen supply centers are neutral at game-start.

<li>
Morocco is separated from North Africa and is a neutral SC.
This reflects the fact that Morocco was independent in 1900 and
also a tremendous source of friction between the Great Powers.

<li>
What's left of North Africa is split into two spaces: Algeria
and Southern Algeria.  Algeria is a French SC. This represents France's
dominant presence in the area.

<li>
The Tyrrhenian Sea touches Algeria, where it doesn't touch North Africa in
<b>Diplomacy</b>. This makes it easier for Italy to stake a claim on French
territory.

<li>
Tunisia is no longer an SC. It is now simply a
buffer between two supply centers, French Algeria and neutral Tripolitania.

<li>
Libya appears on the map and is represented by two spaces: Tripolitania,
a neutral SC, and Cyrenaica, which serves as a buffer
between Tripolitania and British Egypt.
Though Turkey controlled Tripolitania and Cyrenaica
in 1900, the fact that the former is a neutral SC rather than Turkish reflects
the Ottoman Empire's increasingly loose hold on the
area.

<li>
Egypt appears on the map and is a British SC.  The British undeniably felt
Egypt was a key territory in their vast empire in 1900.  Never mind that the
Turks felt Egypt belonged to them. Having a British SC
within arms reach of Turkish territory dramatically increases the need for
British, and therefore French and German, interaction with not only Turkey,
but also Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia.

<li>
Syria has been renamed Damascus and is a Turkish SC. At the same time, Smyrna
has been renamed Konya and is no longer a Turkish SC. This flip-flop makes it
more difficult for Turkey to establish a dominant position in the southeast
corner of the map. 

<li>
Two additional Turkish spaces appear on the map, Palestine and Hejaz.
Palestine's primary purpose is to serve as a buffer between Turkish Damascus
and British Egypt.

<li>
A new neutral space, Arabia, is sandwiched in between Damascus, Palestine,
and Hejaz. 

<li>
Turkey controls a large territory in the Balkans called Macedonia.  Macedonia
has two coasts, east and west, and touches no less than eight other spaces.
Albania, which came into existence in 1912 after the Balkan Wars, no longer
exists. 

<li>
Moscow is split into two spaces: Moscow and Siberia. This
division frustrates the formation of stalemate lines. 

<li>
Trieste is split into two spaces: Trieste and Bosnia.  In 1900, Bosnia
was under Austro-Hungarian administration, but was not technically a part of
the Dual Monarchy. The Dual Monarchy's
annexation of nominally Turkish Bosnia in 1908 nearly resulted in WWI erupting
six years early. 

<li>
Vienna no longer touches Galicia.  Instead, Budapest now touches Bohemia.
Not only is this geographically correct, as a look at a map of the Czech
Republic today will confirm, it also prevents a particularly nasty tactic
that Austria-Hungary and Germany could use against Russia
given the new unit at-start positions discussed shortly. 

<li>
Venice is no longer an SC. This diffuses the
tension between <b >Diplomacy's</b> weak sisters, Austria-Hungary and Italy.
Venice is also renamed Venetia. 

<li>
A new space, Milan, is an Italian SC. 

<li>
Tuscany no longer exists. Rome now borders the Gulf of Lyon,
Piedmont, and Milan.  This helps Italy reinforce its northern position. 

<li>
A Gibraltar space is added. Gibraltar divides the south coast of Spain
in two (i.e., Spain now has three coasts: north, east, and west).
Gibraltar is a sea space for convoy purposes, but
an army can move there from either Morocco or Spain, and
prevent a fleet from entering. 

<li>
Ruhr is renamed Cologne and is a German SC. This additional SC
makes the Reich more formidable and allows it to serve as more of a
counterweight to <b >Diplomacy’s</b> Big Boys,
France and Russia.

<li>
A new space, Alsace, separates French Burgundy from German Cologne and Munich.
This prevents the Kaiser from taking advantage of the new German unit
at-start position to perpetrate evil on France during the first game-turn. 

<li>
Holland is renamed Netherlands.

<li>
Switzerland is a neutral SC. This makes for some
very interesting dynamics between Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, and Italy. 

<li>
Ireland borders the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
<li>
Iceland, Ireland, and Switzerland are now passable. 

<li>
Movement between Clyde and Ireland is allowed. This is true even if an enemy
fleet is in the North Atlantic Ocean.  A convoy is not required to move an
army back and forth between Clyde and Ireland.

<li>
Army movement is allowed between Gibraltar and Morocco.
No convoy is required in this case.  Gibraltar is
considered a sea space for convoy purposes.

<ul>
<li>
Austria-Hungary starts with an army in Trieste instead of a fleet.
The Imperial and Royal Army was the glue that held the Empire together.
The undernourished Austro-Hungarian Navy was
little more than an afterthought. This
third army greatly enhances the Dual Monarchy's flexibility and options. 

<li>
Britain starts with four units: F London, F Edinburgh, F Gibraltar, and F Egypt.
Note that Liverpool is
still an SC, but the army that starts there in <b 
>Diplomacy</b> is gone. At the
same time, note that Gibraltar is not an SC.
Britain
was the premier sea power at the turn of the century, but its puny army was
almost embarrassing for a nation of Britain's
stature. The vaunted, and diminutive,
British Expeditionary Force wasn't formed until just before WWI. 

<li>
France starts with four units: A Paris, F Brest, A Marseilles, and A Algeria.
The last unit reflects the military presence France
maintained in its African territories.
The strong French garrison was no doubt a prudent deterrent given
Italian ambitions to establish an African empire that the Romans themselves
would have been proud of. 

<li>
Germany starts with four units: A Berlin, A Cologne, F Kiel, and A Munich.
The supremacy of the German army was acknowledged, grudgingly, by all of
the Great Powers.  In standard <b>Diplomacy</b>, however, Germany
seems pathetically weak when compared to the actual colossus that was the
Second Reich. The additional army gives the Kaiser real options to conduct
a two-front war if necessary or desired. 

<li>
The Italian army that started in Venice now starts in Milan. 

<li>
The Turkish army that started in Smyrna now starts in Damascus.

<p>
With the few exceptions discussed below, all rules for <b>Diplomacy</b>
apply to <b >1900</b> as well.  In all but two cases, the rule changes
represent little more than minor revisions to account for the new map.
The two major exceptions are the Suez Canal Rules and the
Russian Emergency Measures (REM) <!Steamroller> Rule.
The Suez Canal Rules are a series of rules governing
movement and combat between the Mid-Atlantic Ocean space and the Egypt/Hejaz
spaces. These rules serve to give <b>1900</b> a distinct character primarily
because they dramatically increase the need for all of the Great Powers to talk
to each other from the beginning of the game, an end state the
variant creator definitely hoped
to achieve.
The Russian Emergency Measures <!Steamroller> Rule
<!(hereafter simply Steamroller)> was
a late addition to the variant rules that was felt necessary to enhance
play balance.  This rule's purpose is to boost Russia's
defensive prospects after repeated game play showed that Russia
was not achieving the results that had been anticipated. 

<p>
The minor rule changes go as follows: 

<ul>
<li>
Victory conditions have not changed.  If a Great Power gains control of eighteen
supply centers, the game ends and the player controlling that Great Power is declared the
winner. With thirty-nine supply centers, though, it is now possible for two Great Powers
to get eighteen supply centers on the same game-turn.
Should this happen, the player representing the Great Power with the
most supply centers is the winner. If the two Great
Powers each control the same number of supply centers, play continues until one Great
Power controls at least eighteen supply centers and that Great Power controls more supply centers
than any other Great Power. 

<li>
Egypt and Algeria, while controlled by Britain and France
respectively at game-start, are not considered home supply centers.
This means that Britain may not build in Egypt and France may
not build in Algeria.  This also explains why Egypt
is not called Cairo and Algeria not called Algiers.
</ul>

<p>The Suez Canal Rules go like this:

<ul>
<li>
A fleet may move back and forth between Egypt
and Hejaz. 

<li>
Movement between Egypt or Hejaz and the Mid-Atlantic Ocean is allowed.
It is assumed the unit travels around the southern tip of Africa.
A unit that moves in this manner does so at half strength.
This means that a unit adjacent to Egypt or Hejaz succeeds in moving
there if opposed only by a fleet moving from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean
and a fleet adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean succeeds in moving there if
opposed only by a fleet moving from Egypt or Hejaz. 

<li>
A fleet in Egypt or Hejaz cannot support a unit holding in or moving to
the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  This is true even though the fleet in Egypt
or Hejaz can itself move to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
Likewise, a fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean cannot support a unit holding
in or moving to Egypt or Hejaz. 

<li>
A fleet moving from Egypt or Hejaz to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean does not cut
support being provided by a fleet already in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean unless
the attack results in F Mid-Atlantic Ocean being dislodged.
The opposite is equally true. A fleet moving from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean
to Egypt or Hejaz does not cut support being provided by a unit already
in Egypt or Hejaz unless the attack results in the unit being dislodged.

<li>
F Mid-Atlantic Ocean can convoy an army from or to Egypt or Hejaz.
An army convoyed from Egypt or Hejaz attacks its destination space at full
strength. An army convoyed to Egypt or Hejaz attacks at half strength.

<li>
If two units are retreating to Egypt or Hejaz, or the Mid-Atlantic
Ocean, and one of them must travel around the southern tip of Africa,
the unit that does not travel around southern Africa may retreat while
the other unit is disbanded.
</ul>
<p>
The Russian Emergency Measures Rule goes like this:
<p>
Russia's greatest military assets at the dawn of the 20th century were
its seemingly endless supply of manpower and its vast resources.
Unfortunately, terrible mismanagement and a weak economy prevented Russia from
successfully
exploiting these assets.  If Russia were to suffer a severe setback, such as
is implied by the loss of a home supply center, it seems reasonable to assume
the Russian government would be shocked into taking drastic measures to
overcome the situation, to include stripping the many garrisons stationed
throughout
the Asiatic portions of the Empire and better managing its limited industrial
capability.  In game terms, this is done as follows:
<ul>
<li>    Whenever Russia possesses at least one,
<b><i>but not all four</i></b>,
of its original home supply centers, it is entitled to maintain one extra
unit on the map (i.e., one more than the number of supply centers it currently
controls).  Additionally, while Russia is in this condition, the Russian player
may use Siberia as a build site during the adjustment phase, if Siberia is
unoccupied.
<li>Should Russia fail to possess at least one home supply center
<b>or</b> should it regain possession of all four of its home supply centers,
the ability to
maintain an extra unit is lost and any excess units must be disbanded during the
subsequent adjustment phase.  Further, Siberia reverts to its normal status
(that is, it is no longer a build site).
<li>Note that Siberia, while it may become a build site, <b><i>never</i></b>
attains supply center status.
</ul>
<!--
<p>
The Steamroller reflects the seemingly endless reserves of
manpower that were available to the Tsar at the turn of the century.
In game terms, this is done as follows:
<ul>
<li>Russia is allowed to have one additional unit while the Tsar controls
at least one of the four Russian home supply centers.
<li>
If other Powers control <i>all four</i> Russian home supply centers
(with control being determined after the Fall retreats), the ability
to maintain an
additional unit is lost and Russia may only field a number of units equal
to the number of supply centers it actually controls.
<li>Should Russia regain a home SC, it would again be eligible to field
an additional unit, though this unit would need to be built in an open
home SC as per normal build rules.
<li>Note that the additional unit does not appear at the start of the game,
as there is no vacant home SC to put it in.
</ul>

So, there you have it.  As you can see, <b>1900</b> is, at heart, just like
the game of <b>Diplomacy</b> that we have all come to know and love.  The map,
unit, and rule changes do, however, alter the dynamics of how the Great Powers
interact with each other.
Once you've played, I think you'll agree that it was well worth your
time. In fact, I expect you'll be so impressed with <b>1900</b> that you may
have a tough time going back to conventional Diplomacy.
