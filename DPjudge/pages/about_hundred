The normal rules of the game of Diplomacy apply, with the following additions,
exceptions, and clarifications.

<p><li>
The standard map is replaced by the "Hundred" variant map, representing
England, France, the Lowlands and the Iberian peninsula at the time of
the Hundred Years War.

<p><li>
There are three great powers. The starting units are as follows:
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th class=bodycopy bgcolor=#cc0000><font color=white>Burgundy</th>
	<td><tt>Army<br>Dijon</tt></tt>
	<td><tt>Army<br>Luxembourg</tt></tt>

	<td><tt>Fleet<br>Holland</tt></tt>

</table></center>
 
<p><li>
The game phases are not called "Spring" and "Fall," but the same rhythm of play
as in standard Diplomacy is followed.  The game begins in 1425. Each turn
represents five "real time" years, and has a movement phase followed by a
retreat phase. Alternating turns have an adjustment phase (after retreats
if required); the first of these being in 1430.

<p><li>
There are seventeen supply centers on the board. The winner is the power
which holds nine or more supply centers during an adjustment phase.

<p><li>
A power may build in any vacant supply center it owns during an adjustment
phase: there are no permanent "home centers." For example, France may build
in London if it is vacant and if France owns it.

<p><li>
<u>Multi-Coast Provinces.</u>
Northumbria has two coasts, West and East. Aragon has two coasts, North
and South. Castile is not divided into coasts, so fleets entering Castile
from Biscay can then proceed to the Mediterranean and vice versa.

<p><li>
<u>Land Bridge.</u>
Units (armies and fleets) may move or give support from London to
Calais or vice versa regardless of the presence of a fleet in the Strait
of Dover. 

<p><li>
<u>Provence.</u>
To represent the reliance on underpaid mercenary units, France begins the
game with more units than it can afford. The army in Provence is considered
a mercenary unit, and since this unit does not start in a Supply Center, France
must capture at least one Supply Center before the initial adjustments in 1430
to maintain all five units.  Should France fail to capture a Supply Center,
it will be forced to remove one unit; however, it need not be the actual unit
that started in Provence.  Instead, if he wishes, the French ruler may
discharge other troops and keep the Provincial unit in his service.
<P>
Other than the ability to survive the first two game-turns without a
supporting supply center, the unit in Provence is identical to
all other French units, and its entry into conflict is at equal strength with
all other units. Even in 1425, the unit moves and supports at full strength.
<P>
Provence is <b>not</b> a Supply Center and no units may be built there, nor
does occupation of Provence provide any support for any unit.

<!--
 6d) Variant: The English player may choose to start his Fleet Devon as Fleet English Channel. This gives England more striking power early in the game.  The decision to use this optional rule should be made prior to assigning powers to players. Obviously, the English Channel is not a supply center and no future English units can be built there, nor does occupation of the English Channel provide any support for any units.
