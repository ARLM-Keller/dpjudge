This variant was created by Rod Walker and Nick Fitzpatrick, who are
both genuine Diplomacy legends.
<P>
Here are some suggestions as to what may have happened to the powers
in Aberration to cause them to achieve Great Power status:
<dl>
<dt><b>
Burgundy</b><dd>
   The final confrontation between the civilization of the Seine and
            the Saone was no sure thing for the Parisian monarch.  In this
            instance the victor was the Burgundian dynastic state, stretching
            from the Rhone to the North Sea.

<dt><b>
Byzantium</b><dd>
  This empire might have survived had the Turks failed to make a
            landing in Europe.  The population of western Asia Minor was
            still basically Greek in the 1400s.  Some strong emperors could
            have given the Greek state a new lease on life.

<dt><b>
Hungary</b><dd>
    Hungary was a budding great power until the Turkish invasions.  A
            strong Byzantium would have prevented that, and Hungary, not
            Austria, could have become the great Danubian power.

<dt><b>
Eire</b><dd>
       If Irish missionary activity had been followed by political
            action on behalf of their fellow Celts, the Anglo-Norman imperium
            at London might have been still-born.  All the Irish needed was
            some real unity, which they almost achieved on occasion.

<dt><b>
Israel</b><dd>
     This could be a continuation of the ancient dynastic state under
            descendants of the Maccabees or the Herods.  Just as likely,
            however, it would be representative of the final victory of the
            Crusaders in the Middle East.  It might therefore be called the
            "Kingdom of Jerusalem."

<dt><b>
Poland</b><dd>
     The Poles had many opportunities to overwhelm both the Russian
            and the eastern Germans.  We must here assume that one
            such opportunity finally afforded success.

<dt><b>
Sicily</b><dd> 
    This island once had an excellent chance of gaining control of
            most of Italy under a powerful and aggressive Norman dynasty. 
            These rulers died out, and Sicily became  the pawn of others. 
            Here we assume that the Norman dynasty did not die out.

<dt><b>
Spain</b><dd>
      This could be a Christian Spain which somehow remained powerful
            despite a long succession of cretinous monarchs.  Perhaps they
            were spared the third-rate Hapsburgs and Bourbons who were
            thrust upon them.  Another possibility is that this is
			a Muslim Spain, which case we
            should perhaps refer to it as the "Caliphate of Toledo" (a change
			of capital from Cordova).

<dt><b>
Ukraine</b><dd>
    The original Russian state was centred at Kiev, and we suppose
            here that this southern center remained dominant rather than
            losing out to the northern centres at Vladivostok and Moscow.  These
            people would, however, continue to call their land "Russia" or
            something like it, so Ukraine is perhaps a misnomer for this
			power.
