		<b>What is Crystal Ball Diplomacy anyway?</b><br>
	Basically, Crystal Ball Diplomacy is a standard game of Diplomacy (on any
	game map, etc.) in which you cannot see what happens on each turn
	until your moves for the <i>next</i> turn are written.
	Each player must guess or deduce what the board will look like to have
	the best chance of successfully ordering his units to meet his objectives.
	Think of it as having to sit far from the battles and have your orders
	to the armies and navies dispatched by carrier pigeon, and needing to
	conduct a complete campaign that way.

<P><b>Okay, but what is the game of Diplomacy?</b><br>
	If you asked this question, you have my sympathy that you managed to
	live long enough to form intelligent questions without becoming
	acquainted with -- nay, addicted to -- Diplomacy.  I won't answer the
	question here, but will instead refer you to the Internet home page
	of the Diplomacy hobby, <a href=<POUCH>>The
	Diplomatic Pouch</a>, where you can find the answer you seek.
	The Pouch is chock full of more information on The Game
	than you can digest in one sitting -- one place to start is
	<a href=<POUCH>/Welcome.html>The Pouch's "Welcome"
	page</a>, where I wrote a quickie overview of Diplomacy itself.
	<i>(Head for The Pouch now, because
	the rest of these questions are answered assuming that you are familiar
	with Diplomacy, and most Crystal Ball players cut their teeth on the
	standard game first before trying to deal with the possibility that their
	own units won't obey orders.)</i>

		<b>How do I issue orders if I don't know where my
pieces will be located?</b><br>
	If you issue an order for a unit that isn't there (for example,
	if you order an army in Paris to move to Burgundy, but there is
	no army in Paris when the time comes for your orders to be issued),
	the order has no effect.  Perhaps this is because the army already moved
	to Burgundy on the previous turn (you had thought perhaps it would
	bounce) -- if so, hopefully you have also issued an order for an army
	in Burgundy in case this is indeed what happened.

<P><b>Looks like I'll have to guess where my units will
end up.  No problem.  I'll just issue an order for a unit in every single
place on the board and those that are mine will follow those orders.
Can't I just do this?</b><br>
	No, you can't just do this.  If you could, everyone would do it, and
	what fun would that be?
	You need to make your best attempt to learn where your units will be,
	because the number of wrong guesses you can make on a turn is limited.
	<P>
	Each player's order list can contain only a certain number of
	orders that will be "considered."  After that number, any orders
	appearing later in the list are completely ignored.
	<P>
	The number of
	orders that will be "considered" is the same as the number of supply
	centers held by the largest power on the board.
	<P>
	So if you are the largest power on the board and you want to issue
	an order to every one of your units, you have no room for error.
	You have to know (or guess correctly) where every one of your units
	will be if you truly wish to get an order to each and every one of them.
	By contrast, a smaller power can issue more orders than he has units,
	which allows him more of a chance to "find" and issue orders to each
	of his units.

<P><b>So you're saying I always have one set of
orders that I've pre-issued, and they're "locked-in," right?  Well,
what if it turns out I was wrong about where my units ended up.  Can
I change my "locked-in" orders?</b><br>
	No.  That's why they're called "locked-in."  There is, however, one
	(and only one) exception.
	<P>
	You <i>will</i> be allowed to <i>rearrange</i> the sequence of the
	orders in your "locked-in" list for the first Fall phase of the game
	(that is, you may add no new orders, and remove no currently listed
	orders), if and only if the GameMaster allows you to do so.
	You must request permission to do this, and the GameMaster must agree
	that your reason for the request is because it is apparent from your
	order list that it was written in ignorance of Rule 3.1.
	<P>
	Rule 3.1 limits the number of orders that each player will have
	at his useful disposal.  Here is an example of a Fall 1901 order
	list written in obvious ignorance of Rule 3.1.
	<dl><dd><tt>
		F ENG S A PIC - BEL<br>
		F BRE - ENG<br>
		A BUR S A PIC - BEL<br>
		A MAR - BUR<br>
		A PIC - BEL</tt></dd></dl>
	The obvious intention of this order list is to provide as much
	support as possible to a move from Picardy to Belgium.  However,
	by virtue of Rule 3.1, the fifth and subsequent orders in the list
	are completely ignored, so the Picardy army will not receive
	the order to move to Belgium.  The French player wanted to cover both
	his uncertainties (that his Springtime moves to the English Channel
	and to Burgundy may have bounced) but he cannot.  If the GameMaster
	notices this type of order list, or if he is requested by the owner
	of such an order list, he would allow the player to re-sequence the
	orders in the list.
	<P>
	Notice that this exception is made <i>only</i> for the order list
	submitted for the <i>first Fall movement phase</i> of the game, and
	that it allows the player <i>only</i> to re-sequence the orders he
	had already submitted.

<P><b>What happens if I list more than one order for a
particular unit?</b><br>
	The unit will follow the <i>last</i> order that you give it before using
	up your allotment of "considered" orders.  The earlier ones will be marked
	<tt>revoked</tt>.

<P><b>What if a unit doesn't receive any order at all?
What will it do?</b><br>
	It will <tt>HOLD</tt>.

<P><b>Will the other players see my order list?  Will
they see how confused I am and/or what I would have done to them had my
units been in place?  Or will they only see the results of the moves,
and wonder why so many of my units were ordered to <tt>HOLD</tt> and
what I was planning had I not been so wrong about where they are?</b><br>
	In (most) Crystal Ball games that allow press, the order lists are
	kept secret until the end of the game.  A player can see his own
	order lists going back to the beginning of the game, but has no access
	to the order list of any of the other players.  Once the game is
	finished, though, all order lists become public knowledge.
	<p>
	In games with<i>out</i> press, however, the order lists <i>are publicly
	broadcast</i> with the results of each movement phase.  Players <i>do</i>
	see each and every order listed in all other players' order lists --
	including those that are marked <tt>no&nbsp;unit</tt> and those that
	fall after the limit of "considered" orders and which are therefore marked
	<tt>ignored</tt>.  This makes the order list a tool for communication
	among players (although the signals you may try to send using your
	ignored orders are going to be a season out-of date by the time they
	are read!).

		<b>It sounds like if a smaller power has a good idea of
where all his units are, he will have slots in his order list for which he has
no use.  If I'm a larger or more confused power,
is it possible for me to "borrow" some of those unused slots from him to
help me out?</b><br>
	Yes, it is.  You can proxy one or more of your units to another power
	in hopes that he will be willing to devote extra room in his
	list to help you out by giving your unit an order.  For example,
	if you make a move from Brest to the English Channel and you are not
	sure whether that move will succeed, you would like in your next
	order list to issue an order both for a fleet in the English Channel
	and one in Brest (just in case).  However, if you do not have room in your
	"considered" orders, you could allow either or both of these
	orders to be given by proxy by another player.

<P><b>Wait a minute!  What's the use in that?  Issuing a
proxy order still takes up one of my "considered" orders, doesn't it?</b><br>
	No, it doesn't.  Proxy orders are <i>not</i> counted under 
	"considered" orders limit discussed above.
	Instead, they are counted <i><u>and limited</u></i> separately.  
	<P>
	Each player may issue only a certain number of proxy orders on a turn.
	This number is the number of supply centers owned by the
	<i><b>smallest</b></i> uneliminated power in the game.  Contrast this
	with the maximum number of "considered" <i>non-</i>proxy orders,
	which is the supply count of the <i>largest</i> power in the game.
	<P>
	This separate limit makes it worth the while of the largest
	power on the board to see that the smallest power is not so small
	that the leader has insufficient proxies to offer to his allies.  However,
	it also makes it in the interests of the smaller powers to shrink
	one power, located far from the leader if possible, to near elimination,
	thus limiting the leader's proxy capability (assuming he is
	using that capability well in concert with a loyal ally).

<P><b>How do I issue a proxy order?</b><br>
	List the unit, then a <tt>P</tt> (or the word <tt>PROXY</tt>, etc.),
	and then the <i>full name</i> of the power to be given the proxy.  For
	example: <ul><dd><tt>F BRE P ENGLAND</tt></dd></ul>

<P><b>What happens if I proxy a unit to another player
and that other player does not issue an order to the unit?</b><br>
	The unit will <tt>HOLD</tt>.

<P><b>What happens if I proxy a unit to another player
and he in turn proxies it to yet another player (or back to me)?</b><br>
	Again, the unit will <tt>HOLD</tt>.  The power receiving a
	proxy from the player who actually owns a unit must either
	order the unit or leave it unordered (to <tt>HOLD</tt>).  If
	he instead issues a proxy order for the unit, it will be marked
	<tt>reProxy</tt> and rendered invalid.

		<b>What if I wish to <i>support</i> the move of a fleet in
Constantinople to a particular coast of Bulgaria?  The Website
is not letting me enter the order.  How do I do it?</b><br>
	You cannot.  You may offer support for the fleet to move to Bulgaria,
	but not to a specific <i>coast</i> of Bulgaria.  This is the proper
	implementation of the Diplomacy rules -- support is directed to a
	<i>space</i>, not to a specific <i>coast</i>.

<P><b>What if I don't know whether I will have an
army or a fleet in a certain place, but I wish to give it the same
order?  Can I omit the unit type?</b><br>
	No, you cannot.  If, for example, you wish to use your
	London unit (whose type -- army or fleet -- you don't know)
	to support a unit in Wales,
	you would need to use up two of your "considered" orders to ensure that
	the unit receives your order:
	<ul><dd><tt>A LON S F WAL<br><dd>F LON S F WAL</tt></ul>
	<i>(Note that if you are unsure which type of unit will be in Wales,
	you <b><u>can</u></b> omit <b><u>its</u></b> unit type -- see the answer
	to the next question for an example of this.)</i>


<P><b>Do I need to include the type of unit <i>receiving</i>
a support? Or can I say I wish to support a unit no matter what its type
might happen to be (in case I don't know which type of unit will be there)?
</b><br>
	The answer to the first question is no, and to the second question is
	yes.  You may specify a support (or convoy) order that does not
	specify the type (army or fleet) of the other involved unit.  For
	example:
	<ul><dd><tt>A BEL S GAS - BRE</tt></ul>
	will be valid for a move to Brest made from Gascony by either an army
	or a fleet, and
	<ul><dd><tt>A BUR S GAS</tt></ul>
	will be valid to support whichever type of unit (army or fleet) happened
	to be in Gascony.

		<b>
How does the first turn work?</b><br>
	Before the orders for the first turn are processed, all players must have
	entered orders for <i>both</i> the first and second movement phases.  No
	player may enter orders for the second movement phase until <i>after
	<u>all</u> players have entered orders for the first phase.</i>
	<P>
	When the final player to
	enter orders for the first phase submits valid orders -- <i>and as
	<u>soon</u> as he does so!</i> -- the orders for all players are "locked
	down" and notice is sent to all players indicating that orders for the
	second movement phase may be entered.

<P><b>What about retreat and adjustment phases?  Do I 
"forecast" orders for those phases of the game too?</b><br>
	No.  All of a player's retreat, build, and remove orders are issued
	"in real time," as they occur.  That is, you would issue a Spring
	retreat order only after the Spring movement phase actually happens,
	which is after you have "locked in" your Fall movement orders.  
	In retreat and adjustment phases, therefore,
	a Crystal Ball game is just like a standard Diplomacy game.
	Just as you enter your movement phase order lists at the Website,
	you can issue your retreat and adjustment phase orders here too.

<P><b>
Will moves process before the deadline if all players get their (next)
order list submitted?
</b><br>
	The short answer is, "Yes; assuming no player has set his <i>wait flag</i>."
	The complete answer to this and other similar questions can be found on the

		<b>Can I set a bookmark (fans of Bill Gates: a "favorite")
that will get me straight to my Crystal Ball game?</b><br>
	Yes.  Paste the following lines together into a single line, with
	no included whitespace, and there you have it:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		http://www.floc.net/dpjudge?<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		password=<font color=red><i>yourPassword</i></font></tt>
<P><b>How do I change my password at the Crystal Ball Central 
Website?</b><br>
	You must use the e-mail interface to do this (sending a
	<tt>SET&nbsp;ADDRESS</tt> or <tt>SET&nbsp;PASSWORD</tt> command).
	See <a href=<URL>?page=Email#8>the details on these commands</a>
	in the <a href=<URL>?page=Email>questions about the DPjudge
	e-mail interface</a>.

<P><b>Where can I get a PostScript viewer so that I can
	see the "Season By Season" Maps?</b><br>
	At the <a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost>Ghostscript, Ghostview,
	and GSview</a> site.  You need ghostscript (which is called <tt>gs</tt>
	if you need it for a Personal Computer) <b><u>and</u></b> ghostview
	(<tt>gsview32</tt> for the PC).  Downloading and installing ghostview
	(<tt>gsview32</tt>) should drag ghostscript along with it and set you
	all up.  It should even tell your Web browser to use gsview to view
	PostScript files (if it doesn't, you can teach your Web browser to
	do so yourself).  Note that you will want to set the "Orientation"
	in ghostview to "Seascape" to show the map right-side-up.

<P><b>So there's an e-mail interface to which I can send
my press messages?  What do I need to know?</b><br>
	In addition to composing and sending press at the Crystal Ball Central
	Website, you can
	indeed send it from your favorite e-mail application.  Everything
	you need to know about how to do so is in the
	<a href=<URL>?page=Email>E-Mail Interface Question
	and Answer List</a>.
